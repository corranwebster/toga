The columns of `Table` and `Tree` widgets can now be specified by arbitrary `Columns` that match the `ColumnT` protocol.  The list of columns is exposed as a read-only attribute on the `Table` and `Tree` objects, and column objects can be passed as arguments to the `insert_column`, `append_column` and `remove_column` methods.
